Globals - no window !!!
__dirname   - path to current directory
__filename  - file name
require     - function to use modules(common js)
modules     - info about current module(file)
process     - info about env where the prgrm is being executed

__Modules in node__
Every file in a node is a module.
Modules - Encapsulated code (only share minimum).
to export module data we need to append objects in module.exports
ex:module.exports={n1,n2}
where n1 and n2 are 2 variables

__Built in modules__
os
path 
fs
http 
for built in modules we n eed not give relative path
ex: require('os')

NPM (nutty professor movie):
    npm - global command comes with node
    npm --version

    local dependency - use it only in this particular project
    npm i <packages> (it is basically like using that particular package in that env only 
                        outside that env it has no use.)

    global depenendency - use it in any project
    npm install -g <package name>
    sudo npm install -g <package name> (mac)
    (we can use it any where in our pc for creating different projects.)

package.json - manifest file (stores imp info about project/package)
manual approach (create package.json in the root, create properties etc)
npm init (step by step, press enter to skip)
npm init -y (everything default)
