java script is a both programming and scripting language
java script was developed in 5 days
it is an interpreter based language

//BROWSER
layout engine
renders html ,css
Js engine
renders js

//data types
primitive: which can not be divide further
ex: string, number, boolean, undefined, null, bigint

three types implementation
intenal, inline, console

console is a web api
disadvantages 
not sharable , temporary

we need external files due to SOC (separation of concerns) 
<script src=".js file path"></script>
var, let, const are used to create variablez
variables properties
can not start with no.s and symbols
case sensitive
no spaces
keywords can't be used as vars
"_" and $ can be used even in start also
ways of defining variables
ex:
    let firstname= "shinchan nohara" (normal case)
    let firstName= "shinchan nohara" (camel case)
    let first_name= "shinchan nohara" (snake case)
    let f-name= "shinchan nohara" (kebab case(not allowed in js))

//concatenation
let fn="Gabbar"
let ln= "Singh"
console.log(fn+" "+ln)

methods of writing string
"",'',
``(tilde,back ticks,template literals, string literals)
let s1="hi"
let s2='hi'
let s3=`s1=${s1} s2=${s2}` (used to created formatted string)

// number
let num=10
operations(+,-,*,/,**,%,//)

to get max length of chars a datatype can hold
console.log(Number.MAX_INT_VALUE)

JS dosen't support negative indexing
ex: str[-5](not supported)

in js we need not to tell datatype during defining variables
so its a "weakly typed language"
Js is interpreted, weakly typed ,p/s language
in js variables data type is evaluated at a time of run time, (dynamic language)

Js is interpreted, weakly typed ,dynamically typed, p/s language
undefined refers neither js nor user knows the data type
for ex: 
    let s;
    console.log(s)
    it will give undefined data type

string methods:
    substr(depricated)
    substring
    indexof
    replace
    replaceall
    repeat
    touppercase
    tolowercase
    trim()
